# AI in the Software Engineering Industry

## Learning Goals

- Give an overview AI usage in the software engineering industry.

## Introduction

Companies have started making consumer facing products based on AI. However,
they have been incorporating AI into their products and using AI to analyze data
for years.

We will discuss two broad areas of AI usage among software engineers:

1. Core Business Development.
2. Learning Process and Development Workflow.

## Core Business Development

The “core business” of a company represents the central products or services
that the company provides to its customers or clients. For example, Starbucks
provides coffee and a consistent, familiar experience for its customers.

Companies have been incorporating using ML models to augment their product
features, improve their services, and make better decisions.

We’ll briefly discuss 2 examples:

1. Starbucks uses a
   [system called Atlas](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-digit/submission/starbucks-grinding-data/)
   to decide where to open new stores. This system takes into account various
   features such as population density, traffic patterns, consumer habits to
   estimate the economic viability of various locations.
2. Netflix uses ML to augment search with
   [in-session adapted recommendations](https://research.netflix.com/publication/Augmenting%20Netflix%20Search%20with%20In-Session%20Adapted%20Recommendations).
   If a user has been watching stand-up comedy shows in a particular session,
   they will be recommended similar shows when they use the search
   functionality.
3. Wildlife Conservation institutes have been using
   [AI to automate wildlife tracking and monitoring](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/03/wildlife-conservation-through-ai/).
   These systems have also been
   [used to detect poachers](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/machine-learning-wildlife-conservation-uavs)
   and prevent them from harming wildlife.

As a software engineer, our goal is to solve problems while considering
requirements and constraints. AI is another tool we can use to design and
develop better systems. Software engineers often work alongside machine learning
scientists to incorporate these models into various systems and processes.

## Learning Process and Development Workflow

[The StackOverflow Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#ai) has started
including an AI section since 2023. They also have an article on the
[Developer Sentiment Around AI/ML](https://stackoverflow.co/labs/developer-sentiment-ai-ml/#h2-how-similar-or-different-do-you-see-your-workflow-in-1-year-as-a-result-of-using-ai-tools)
in their 2023 survey. They break down usage according to subfields in software
engineering.

The key takeaways for us are:

- Most developers are using AI tools in some capacity in their development
  process.
- A large majority have favorable views of using AI tools in their workflow.
- The majority don’t trust the accuracy of the output of AI tools.
- The biggest benefits for developers are increased productivity, greater
  efficiency, and speeding up learning.

Professionals are still in the process of fully understanding how to use these
tools so there isn’t any general consensus on best practices yet.

## Our Recommendations

In this course, we will primarily focus on the second category (Learning Process
and Development Workflow). Software engineers have to constantly learn new
things and make prototypes. Any tool that makes one or both of these processes
faster or easier will greatly improve productivity. This is why we will focus on
learning how to use these tools effectively.

As an early career engineer, it is imperative that you focus on learning the
fundamentals of programming and computer science before trying to incorporate AI
systems into your applications. Once you understand the basics of data modeling
and APIs, you will be able to start using pre-trained ML models.

We will learn how to use AI chat bots to accelerate our learning process, debug
more efficiently, and autogenerate data for prototyping.

## Conclusion

Software engineers are still figuring out how to best use AI to improve their
workflow and productivity. Although most engineers don’t trust the code that’s
generated by AI, they have an overall positive outlook for the role of AI in
development. Meanwhile, an increasing number of companies and institutions are
incorporating ML models into their products and services to great effect.

AI tools are rapidly improving and it’s important to understand how to use them
effectively while being aware of their limitations.
